# Changelog

## 1.1.4 — 2026-04-19

### Security

- **Symlink-safe static serve.** The `public/` static file guard previously used `path.resolve()` + `startsWith()`, which could be bypassed by a symlink planted inside `public/` pointing at e.g. `/etc`. Replaced with `resolveSafe()` from `@grainulation/barn/paths`, which resolves via `fs.realpathSync` and rejects symlink escape. Defense in depth — no known exploit against the prior guard.

### Internal

- CI: install dependencies before running tests
- CI: allow `@grainulation/*` in the zero-dependency gate

## 1.1.3 — 2026-04-19

### Added

- `--version` and `-v` flag support in the orchard CLI
